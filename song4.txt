There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare

See how I'll stay with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my stomach
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the blue
